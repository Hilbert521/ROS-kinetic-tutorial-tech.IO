Hello !

here lies my ROS tutorial for the website tech.io, feel free to copy, reproduce, modify, open issue or make pull request.

# FAQ


# How does it work ?

This tutorial is available on tech.io (Public Link incoming).

Just go, run it, and learn.


# How does it WORK ?

The tutorial is composed of Markdowns, who display text, questions and coding exercise on the page and ros-project, who details how the coding exercise must be run and completed.

A coding exercise can be composed of : 

+ Command Line Interface (CLI)
+ Code Stubs to be run
+ Web page display (In many case in my tutorial, you will see the [web-turtlesim](https://github.com/mlauret/web-turtlesim)
+ Script who display a success/error message on run.

Every Markdown is linked with a directory in ros-project who contains all package to be compiled and run. The package are numbered from 1- to x- depending on their position in the tutorial.

The coding exercise are run in a docker container which is build and run by tech.io

For more complete documentation on tech.io, it's here : https://tech.io/playgrounds/408/tech-io-documentation/create-a-playground


## Why this tutorial ?

This tutorial aim to gives people a new way to learn ROS. You don't have to worry about Ubuntu, configuration files, compilation, installation, etc.

The tutorial is made to learn each concept little by little. Then learner will have to implement every concept by themselves.

Also, it provide a way for people who are interested in ROS but can't install Ubuntu on a Machine (for many reason) to learn, experiment and decide later if investing in a Ubuntu installation worth it (spoiler alert : It worth it)


## Can I copy this tutorial to make my own ?

You can copy MOST of the tutorial.
You cannot copy the videos and images without their owner consent.
See Part 4.C of the CC0 license.

## I don't like the way you wrote this tutorial. You should replace "xxx" with "yyy"

Ok, I understand, I'm not a teacher, I have neither the patience nor the background to transfert knowledge to those who want to learn.

While I can't accept all pull request about this or that part of this tutorial, I will do my best to read all pull request and accept them if I find them usefull or if many people are OK with this, I really want this tutorial to be community-curated.


## Can I redistribute this around me ?

Yes, as long as you gives author of the media (images, video) credit.


## This thing doesn't works

So open an issue, I will do my best to correct it. Or better, open a pull request to correct it ;)


## Do I have add a license file with your name if I modify and publish this work elsewhere ?

While I really want this work to be in the public domain, the law forbid it. So the best I can do is CC0 (Creative Common Zero)

Just be carefull, this works use many other works (ROS, Docker, Tech.IO files, etc.) that have their own license. You cannot says that you created tech.io or ROS.


## Can I use the images/videos/media you put in the tutorial in mine ?

No, be carefull about that too, always ask the authors of a certain works before displaying it. I have asked the authors of the video/media before putting them in the tutorial, but you should do the same.
