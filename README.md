Hello !

here lies my ROS tutorial for the website tech.io, feel free to copy, reproduce, modify, open issue or make pull request.

# FAQ


# How does it work ?

This tutorial is available on tech.io (Public Link incoming).

Just go, run it, and learn.


# How does it WORK ?

The tutorial is composed of Markdows, who display text, questions and coding exercise on the page and ros-project, who details how are the coding exercise composed.

A coding exercise can be composed of : 

+ Command Line Interface (CLI)
+ Code Stubs to be run
+ Web page display (In many case in my tutorial, you will see the web-turtlesim)
+ Script who display a success/error on run.

Every Markdown is linked with a directory in ros-project who contains all package to be compiled and run. The package are numbered from 1- to x- depending on their position in the markdown




## Why this tutorial ?

This tutorial aim to give people wanting to learn ROS an another way of learning. You don't have to worry about Ubuntu, configuration files, compilation, etc.

JUST. FOCUS. ON. THE. CONCEPT.

You will learn little by little every concept. Then you will have to implement every concept by yourself.

Also, it provide a way for people who are interested in ROS but can't install Ubuntu on a Machine (for many reason) to learn, experiment and decide later if investing in a Ubuntu installation worth it (spoiler alert : It worth it)


## Can I copy this tutorial to make my own ?

Yes


## I don't like the way you wrote this tutorial. You should replace "xxx" with "yyy"

Ok, I understand, I'm not a teacher, I have neither the patience nor the background to transfert knowledge to those who want to learn.

While I can't accept all pull request about this or that part of this tutorial, I will do my best to read all pull request and accept them if I find them usefull or if many people are OK with this, I really want this tutorial to be community-curated.

And also, you should have understood, I will accept pull request only. It's only markdown, it's easy to change.


## Can I share your work around me ?

Yes


## This thing doesn't works

So open an issue, I will do my best to correct it. Or better, open a pull request to correct it ;)


## Do I have add a license file with your name if I modify and publish this work elsewhere ?

While I really want this work to be in the public domain, the law forbid it. So the best I can do is CC0 (Creative Common Zero)

Just be carefull, this works use many other works (ROS, Docker, Tech.IO files, etc.) that have their own license. You cannot says that you created tech.io or ROS.


## Can I use the links/videos you put in the tutorial in mine ?

No, be carefull about that too, always ask the authors of a certain works before displaying it.
