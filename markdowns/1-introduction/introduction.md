# Welcome!

Welcome to this Robot Operating System tutorial.
Here you will learn the basic of ROS "Kinetics Kame" version, the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version.

## Will I learn robotics here ?

You will not lear robotics here, you will learn how to use ROS. It's different.
Robotics is a interdisciplinary field :

Some engineer know how to compute the Inverse Kinematics of a 7 DoF Robot. Some don't.

Some engineer know how to tune a PID controller or even build a Model Predictive Controler. Some don't.

Some engineer know how to develop an Artificial Intelligence to talk to people and answers question, Some don't. 


Robotics need all kind of people to be awesome : Robot control, artificial intelligence, Front-end , Back-end, vision processing, hardware guru, etc. 

Of course, the ROS Framework is heavily intended for robots (well, [lights](https://youtu.be/vVxTIRE_5Jc) and [tractors](https://youtu.be/XrazPHtJ89M) sometimes), but the ROS community have already developped "bricks" to help you setup the part you don't know (yet).

tldr; here you will learn the ROS framework.

## The basics

The basics of ROS consist of : 

+ Nodes
+ CLI
+ Packages
  - CmakeLists.txt
  - package.xml
  - Launch files
+ Publisher
+ Subscriber
+ Logging
+ Messages
+ Parameters
+ Services
  - Client
  - Server
  - Service Definition
+ Actions
  - Client
  - Server
  - Action Definition

These are the minimal knowledge to build/run/debug your package and nodes, and to play a little with robots.


## The Intermediate :

+ Introduction to Gazebo simulator
+ How to connect to a robot
+ Bag Files
+ Vizualizing data
+ Introduction to GUI creation
