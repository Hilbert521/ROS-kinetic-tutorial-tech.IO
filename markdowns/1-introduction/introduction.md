# Welcome!

Welcome to this Robot Operating System (ROS) tutorial.
Here you will learn the basic of ROS "Kinetics Kame" version.

## Will I learn robotics here ?

You will not learn the basics of robotics here, you will learn how to use ROS. It's different.

Robotics is a interdisciplinary field :

+ Some engineer know how to compute the Inverse Kinematics of a 7 DoF Robot. Some don't.

+ Some engineer know how to tune a PID controller or even build a Model Predictive Controler. Some don't.

+ Some engineer know how to develop an Artificial Intelligence to talk to people and answers question, Some don't.

Robotics need all kind of people to be awesome : Robot control, artificial intelligence, Front-end , Back-end, vision processing, hardware guru, etc.

Of course, the ROS Framework is heavily intended for robots, drone and autonomous vehicle, but you can find ROS even on [lights](https://youtu.be/vVxTIRE_5Jc) and [tractors](https://youtu.be/XrazPHtJ89M) !

tl;dr here you will learn the ROS framework.

#### I want to deep into coding right now
Go to Chapter 6

## The basics

The basics of ROS consist of :

+ Nodes
+ CLI
+ Packages
  + CmakeLists.txt
  + package.xml
  + Launch files
+ Publisher
+ Subscriber (WIP)
+ Logging (WIP)
+ Messages (WIP)
+ Parameters (WIP)
+ Services (WIP)
  + Client (WIP)
  + Server (WIP)
  + Service Definition (WIP)
+ Actions (WIP)
  + Client (WIP)
  + Server (WIP)
  + Action Definition (WIP)

These are the minimal knowledge to build/run/debug your package and nodes, and to play a little with robots.


## The Intermediate :

+ Introduction to MoveIt! (WIP)
+ How to connect to a real robot (WIP)
+ Bag Files (WIP)
+ Vizualizing data (WIP)
+ Introduction to GUI creation (WIP)

## Thanks

A big thanks to those who supported and reviewed this tutorial before the release, to the contributor, to the media owner and to the awesome ROS community.
