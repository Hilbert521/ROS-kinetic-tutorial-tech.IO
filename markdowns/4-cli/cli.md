# Command Line Interface

Before beeing a set of packages, nodes, and compilation error, your ROS environnement is a set of CLI tools used to generate workspace, packages, compile them and launch them.

Here is an example of CLI for a ROS environmnent : 
@[Click run to open a terminal]({"command": "./open_terminal.bash"})

> Ok cool I have a terminal, I feel like a hacker, but what do I do with it now ?

You have a lot of CLI tools shipped with ROS. Here is some of them : 

- roscd
- rosls
- rosed
- roscp
- rosrun
- rosclean
- rosdep
- rosrun
- roslaunch
- rosmsg
- rosnode
- rospack
- rosparam
- rossrv
- rosservice
- rostopic
- rosversion
- catkin_make
There is some other tools used by ros in CLI, but since I never saw them used by anybody, and some of them are deprecated (officialy or not), I will not describe them : 
- rospd
- rosd
- rosstack 
- rosmake
- roslocate (removed)
- roscreate


> Wait, where is catkin ?

Catkin Tools aim to be a replacement for catkin_make.
